Login and Registration System Using OOP in PHP and MySQL

This is a simple login and registration system that I wrote using PHP and MySQL that will allow the user to login and display the name of the user and display the picture of the picture in the dashboard. I use object-oriented programming approach in writing this code if you like this system please download and use it for free.
